# Email Spam Naive Bayes Classifier

This project is an implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier to classify emails as spam or non-spam, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The classifier is trained on a dataset of labeled emails to learn the probability of each word occurring in a spam or non-spam email.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to install Python and the following libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* nltk
* string

You can install these libraries using pip:


Copy code
```python
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk string
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is [Spam Email](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/spam-email). This dataset contains a collection of labeled emails that can be used for training and testing the classifier.

## Running the Notebook
To run the Jupyter Notebook, simply open the Email Spam Naive Bayes.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell and run the code.

The notebook consists of the following sections:

* Data Loading and Exploration
* Data Preprocessing
* Feature Extraction
* Model Training and Evaluation
* Model Testing
